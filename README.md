# Bareeqs — Premium Static Site (GitHub Pages Ready)

Upgraded design with glass header, gradients, reveal animations, logo wall, testimonials carousel, and enhanced brand tokens.

## Structure
Same as v1, with additional files:
- `assets/js/ui.js` (reveal, smooth anchors, mobile menu)
- `assets/js/carousel.js` (testimonials + client logos)
- `assets/data/testimonials.json`
- `assets/data/clients.json`

## Customize
- Update colors, email, phone, socials in `assets/data/brand.json`.
- Add/remove services/projects/testimonials/clients via JSON — pages update automatically.

## Deploy
Upload to your repo root and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages). Done.
